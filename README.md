## What is object detection
Object detection is one of the most common areas of computer vision science today. It's an extension of image classification, with the aim of identifying one or more groups of objects in an image and using bounding boxes to locate their presence. As a result, object recognition is critical in a variety of real-world implementations, including image acquisition and video monitoring, to name a few.
