# Real-Time-Object-Detection
## What is object detection
Object detection is one of the most common areas of computer vision science today. It's an extension of image classification, with the aim of identifying one or more groups of objects in an image and using bounding boxes to locate their presence. As a result, object recognition is critical in a variety of real-world implementations, including image acquisition and video monitoring, to name a few.

## Installation and Setup
We must now verify that all of the program packages have been installed. Check to see if your computer has [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) installed. If you are using Anaconda, you can type:
```
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```
Alternatively, you can type:
```
pip install opencv-python
```
